# qualify-project
1.) Description of App

I would like to make an app that allows someone to see if they pre-qualify for a home... Most people need to go to a bank to talk with a lender to decide if they can qualify, but by using this app, you will have a solid idea of whether or not you can qualify at just abouy any bank. You see, most banks need to be able to sell a loan to an investor in order for it to qualify. The largest imvestors are FNMA and FHLMC. 

Front-end details: I would like to build an app that takes in a users information, runs some logic with info that has been saved to a database, and decides whether or not that use may qualify for a loan.

Back-end details:  On the back end, I need to have a database that stores all kinds of information about the customer. I need to store basic information like name, address, etc. In addition to annual income information, or even monthly, or bi-weekly income information. Once I have all of the information that I need, I can write the logic to determine whether or not an individual or couple will qualify for a home.
